    "World USD (WUSD) is a decentralized, non-pegged, fixed-supply digital asset that serves as the native token of WERCRY, an upcoming EVM-compatible privacy-enhanced public blockchain. Inspired by the economic model of Bitcoin (BTC), WUSD is not a stablecoin, nor is it backed by fiat reserves. It is a Bitcoin-class asset - scarce, censorship-resistant, and entirely governed by smart contracts.",
    "WUSD is designed to operate across multiple ecosystems and blockchains, while WERCRY will serve as its native Layer 1 network. The project aims to offer a new paradigm of digital value: a decentralized asset with both long-term value storage potential and strong utility within a scalable, privacy-aware blockchain ecosystem."
